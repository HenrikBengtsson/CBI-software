.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
By default checkmake looks for a \f[C]checkmake.ini\f[R] file in the
same folder it\[cq]s executed in.
This can be overridden by passing the \f[C]--config=\f[R] argument
pointing it to a different configuration file.
With the configuration file the \f[C][default]\f[R] section is for
checkmake itself while sections named after the rule names are passed to
the rules as their configuration.
All keys/values are hereby treated as strings and passed to the rule in
a string/string map.
.PP
The following configuration options for checkmake itself are supported
within the \f[C]default\f[R] section:
.TP
.B \f[B]default.format\f[R]
This enables the custom output formatter with the given template string
as a format
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
 0:   checkmake ran successfully and found 0 violations
>1:   checkmake found the number of violations reflected by the exit status
