Warning: To work around a bug where `fasterq-dump` crashes the local machine, it has been tweaked such that it uses `$TMPDIR` rather than `$PWD` as the default temporary folder.")

-- WORKAROUND: fasterq-dump crashes machines!
-- Not sure exactly why, but one hypothesis is that the file system is
-- being hit too hard.  The workaround forces 'fasterq-dump' to use
-- 'TMPDIR' for temporary files rather than the current directory [2]
