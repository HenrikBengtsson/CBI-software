Description: Zellij is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. At its core, it is a terminal multiplexer (similar to tmux and screen), but this is merely its infrastructure layer. Zellij includes a layout system, and a plugin system allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.
Examples: `zellij --version` and `zellij --help`.
Warning: Only the most recent version of this software will be kept.
